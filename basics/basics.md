# Spring basics

#### What is Spring?

Spring Framework is a Java-based framework that provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java applications. It is widely used for building enterprise-level applications and supports dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and transaction management.

Key Features of Spring Framework:
Dependency Injection (DI) – Manages object dependencies automatically, making code more modular and testable.
Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) – Enables separation of cross-cutting concerns like logging and security.
Spring MVC – A framework for building web applications.
Spring Boot – A sub-project that simplifies application setup with auto-configuration.
Spring Data – Simplifies database access with repositories.
Spring Security – Provides authentication and authorization mechanisms.
Spring Cloud – Helps in building microservices-based applications.
Transaction Management – Ensures data consistency in database operations.
Spring follows a loosely coupled architecture, making it easier to develop, test, and maintain applications. It is widely used in enterprise applications, microservices, and cloud-native development.
